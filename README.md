# Digit Recognizer problem
dataset containing images of handwritten digits and each image is 28 x 28 pixels.
Each pixel column in the training set has a name like pixelx, where x is an integer between 0 and 783, inclusive. To locate this pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27, inclusive. Then pixelx is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix, (indexing by zero).

Solved this problem using Machine learning concepts and algorithms like Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Machines.
